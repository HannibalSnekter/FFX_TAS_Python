# FFX TAS Python

This Project aims to speedrun the Steam version of Final Fantasy X using tools such as python, virtual controllers and memory reading.  
This is achieved by reading memory values and sending controller inputs that fit the situation.  
We strive to only include code that is not seed-specific which causes the codebase to be quite large so we can cover as many edge cases as possible.
